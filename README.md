# wp-emfluence


If you're a user of the emfluence Marketing Platform, this plugin is for you!

Easily add forms to your Wordpress website for contacts to add or update their details in your emfluence Marketing
Platform account.
You can add any number of widgetized forms to your website. Each widget form can have different input fields and add
contacts to different contact groups.

If you're not a user of our marketing platform, contact us now to get started with the best digital marketing platform around.

Note that you'll likely want to tailor the forms to your theme using some CSS. You can also template the success message
by copying the theme/success.php file from this plugin to your theme, if you wish (or just type out a success message
in widget settings).
